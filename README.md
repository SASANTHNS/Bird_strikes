# Bird Strikes Dashboard Project

## Project Overview

This project presents a **Bird Strikes Dashboard** that visualizes bird strike incidents in aviation over the years. The dashboard provides insights into various factors such as altitude, total cost, number of people injured, strikes by airport, airline, and engine type. It aims to help aviation authorities and airlines understand the patterns in bird strikes and take preventive measures.

## Objectives

- **Visualize Bird Strikes Data**: Provide a clear view of bird strikes segmented by altitude, year, impact on flights, and number of engines.
- **Analyze Trends**: Help identify trends in bird strike incidents over time, the cost involved, and the safety measures taken.
- **Support Decision Making**: Offer actionable insights for aviation authorities to reduce the risk of bird strikes and improve flight safety.

## Key Metrics Visualized in the Dashboard

1. **Total Bird Strikes**: 
   - Displays the total number of bird strikes, **25,558**, over the years.

2. **Total Cost**:
   - The total cost of bird strikes over the years is **$142.29M** with an average cost per accident of **5,567**.

3. **Impact on Flights**:
   - Bird strikes categorized by **impact on flights**: aborted takeoff, engine shutdown, other incidents, and precautionary landings.

4. **Strikes by Altitude**:
   - Shows the distribution of bird strikes by altitude (e.g., below 1,000 feet and above 1,000 feet).

5. **Strikes by Airport**:
   - The top 50 airports where bird strikes occurred are visualized using a heatmap.

6. **Strikes by Engine Type**:
   - A pie chart visualizing the percentage of strikes based on the number of engines: **91.3%** of strikes involved single-engine aircraft.

7. **Top Airlines Involved**:
   - Displays the top 10 airlines that reported the highest number of bird strikes.

## Tools Used

- **Data Visualization**: Tableau (used to create the interactive dashboard)
- **Data Processing**: SQL, Excel (for cleaning and preparing the dataset)
